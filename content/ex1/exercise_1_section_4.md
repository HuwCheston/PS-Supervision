# Section 4: Interpreting the Data

You should now have generated two clean quantitative data sets, each showing the amount of physical motion in a single musical performance at varying moments of intensity. We now need to carry out statistical analysis to see if there actually is any difference in the motion between the two videos.

## Carry out a paired sample t-Test

The paired sample t-Test is a formal statistical method used to compare the means of two measurements taken from the same individual or object - or, in this case, the same performance at different moments in time. The maths required is fairly complicated to do this manually, but we'll be using an online calculator to make things much simpler.

Browse over to the t-test calculator linked [here](https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1/). In the first box ('Choose data entry format'), select 'Enter or paste up to 2000 rows'. In the second box, choose 'Paired t-test'.

Now, in the third box, copy and paste your two columns. If your video was especially long, you may not be able to enter all your rows and may have to truncate your data slightly. Add a label to each column and click 'Calculate Now'.

## Interpret the t-Test results

The calculator should take you to a new page. There are a lot of figures here, but we are only going to be concerned with the first section, 'P value and statistical significance'.

If the P value of the test is under 0.05, then we can consider our results to be statistically significant - there are statistically valid differences in the amount of motion between the two videos!

If not, then unfortunately there is no significant difference in the motion of the performer between the high and low intensity videos. For now, this is not a problem - statistically insignificant results can actually still be (and often are) interesting, depending on our research question.

## Presenting your findings

On your spreadsheet, make a note of the P value generated from the t-test. Now, highlight both data columns and generate a line chart or histogram to demonstrate the differences in motion between the two. What differences do you notice between the high and low intensity videos? Is musical intensity significantly related to performer body motion? Why (or why not)?
