# Exercise 4 â€“ Vibrato and Pitch

## Research Question:
---
> Are there significant differences in the depth of vocal vibrato between singers of different musical genres?

Controlling the depth, rate, and speed of vocal vibrato is a key expressive device used by singers of many different musical genres. With the advent of accurate pitch analysis tools such as [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) - as well as machine learning-based approaches to isolating vocal tracks from mastered recordings - it is now easier than ever before to accurately measure these (and other) vibrato parameters. 

One previous investigation into this issue comes in a paper by Christian Herbst, Stellan Hertegard, Daniel Zangger-Borch & Per-Ake Lindestad, who conducted an acoustic analysis of Freddie Mercury's vocal vibrato. In this exercise, we will follow their methodology and conduct a similar analysis of recordings from another influential singer, this time of either jazz or classical music.
