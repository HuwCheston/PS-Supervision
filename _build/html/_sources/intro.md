# Supervision Exercises

In preperation for the supervision, I'd like you to carry out a small empirical study into musical expression. 

The following pages contain details about four studies, including research questions, source material, guidance on which software to use, and expected data outputs. Please choose **one** study to complete to start with: if you have the time after, feel free to complete another.

## Structure of the exercises

- Exercise 1: Body Movement and Motion
- Exercise 2: Rhythm and Timing
- Exercise 3: Tempo and Performance Speed
- Exercise 4: Pitch and Vibrato

Exercise 1 will make use of [Motion Energy Analysis](https://psync.ch/mea-motion-energy-analysis/), while the other exercises will use [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Both programs have been used extensively in music psychology research and don't require any prior knowledge of coding or computer programming.

If you have any issues completing any one of these exercises or running any of the software, don't hesitate to email me [here](mailto:hwc31@cam.ac.uk). If you absolutely cannot get the software specified to work, I have sample datasets available that will still allow you to complete the exercise.

**I look forward to seeing what you come up with!**
