# Supervision Exercises

**V4 Build w/updated references - 30/05/2023**

In preperation for the supervision, I'd like you to carry out a small empirical study into musical expression. 

The following pages contain details about four studies, including research questions, source material, guidance on which software to use, and expected data outputs.

## Structure of the task

Complete **one** of the four tasks given below. If you have time after finishing this one, you may go back and complete another.

- Exercise 1: Body Movement and Motion
	- **Musical genres studied:** one from Classical (early 20th Century), Free Improvisation, Indian Classical, Jazz
- Exercise 2: Rhythm and Timing
	- **Musical genres studied:** Jazz
- Exercise 3: Tempo and Performance Speed
	- **Musical genres studied:** Classical (early 19th Century)
- Exercise 4: Pitch and Vibrato
	- **Musical genres studied:** one from 80s Pop, Opera, Jazz

Exercise 1 will make use of [Motion Energy Analysis](https://psync.ch/mea-motion-energy-analysis/), while the other exercises will use [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Both programs have been used extensively in music psychology research and don't require any prior knowledge of coding or computer programming.

## Presenting your results

The final section of each exercise will ask you to answer three small questions related to the task. Please [email me](mailto:hwc31@cam.ac.uk) your answers by **12PM the day before your supervision**. Please also bring your answers to the supervision, either in hard copy or on a laptop.
